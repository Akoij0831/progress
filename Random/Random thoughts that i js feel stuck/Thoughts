<h1>At A Point of My Journey</h1>

    As the year went by experinceing obstacles 
    rather than it being relationships problems,
    e xpections, confusion, and disappointments.
    stuckness, i have been struggling mentally, thorughout 
    childhood,  i have been experincing alot of pain/ traumas 
    doubt, and fear. expericinng loneliness, and sadness. at a very young age,
    from being touched, having relations with someone that i called a friend/brother before
    understanding the hardships of the after math,or being feelings been neglected by someone  i loved,
    or being bullied at school,  or being called name "gay" which lead to question am i gay?  i have experinced alot of  pain/trauma that i have never faced 
    or talked about to anybody.  i already had past traumas, 
    i spent alot of time adjusting/adapting to enivorments,
    and people pleasing to be accepted by others, doing things to get by.
    it  has truly affected other around me hurt others around me, as the past year went by  i realized i bured alot  js to get by to the point  i have hurted someone that 
    in my life that meant alot to me. i never have faced my feeling for a long time
    i have been avoiding my feelings, and emotions for a long time.
    i js pushed them deep down inside of me, at of 20 i am at the point of realzing my self seeing my self more clearly
    and understanding my past traumas , and i have hurt someone around me, that have may not have meant bad i do feel like he had bad intentions a little bit 
    i dont know where to start   i have made alot of mistakes and slowley realize that me and this person does not align anymore 
    and he enjoyed the person that needed him i may not be evyrthing that i have wrote down the paper doing the 6th grade 
    but i have realize my likes and dislike and where do i wanna go and pratice on my own voice 
    and trusting one the thing i have realize overt the years thati had no self regualation,
    i may nit have the experincing in the world but i have skill to learn to never allow people into 
    my life that want one thing from me 
    and they may not have been laughed at me but at the end of they day i am not still on there mind,
    to this day, and one of the remarrk able things that i have realized that some people in your life onely
    want to contol u and when u are at a vunberable state they take advantage of u (everytime) 
    then try to make me the bad guys i dont owe nobody nothing and i am  have came bck home ad realize that i am mentally scatterted to be outside  
    and when you dont know they will take advantage of u    
    and as i came bck home from college where  usupposed to learn i decide to take a break for me and reconnec
    with the person that stirres my life. i have fought alot, for so long, coming from a househoold,  
    i have pushed alot down trying to run and do  things on my own ralize  i am not ready for this world 
    on my terms, i js been running for me i know i may not be that best person, i can run nomore
    i have to face my demons and past traumas and pain that i have been avoiding  for so long
    and i am realizing people dont really care as long as they reap the benfit 
    i have fought a lot in my lifetime

    people to come in my life think shit rey be game and and i am not abou the play this game i know  i am not all that but one thing a person not rey do is conrol 
    me and try  to make it seem like i am this bad person i am responsible for my own actions  but you knoe rey controlled me and act like  uall i got 
    for the past couple i may have thought that but honestly there more people in the world than u aand some degree i can say that  i can be ungrateful
    i have grounded a lot relize i am js running for someone not b
    i feel so out of it, for the way i have spend my young life js adjusting adating,
    holdig expections that was not fully mind  or maybe was (idk)  the way that i felt pressure to grow
    he  not everything,  you know what i mean 
    and it took a long time to see myself living up to someone i dont even knoe hw got in my mind
