<h1>At A Point of My Journey</h1>

<div class="paragraph-box">
As the year went by experinceing obstacles 
rather than it being relationships problems,
e xpections, confusion, and disappointments.
stuckness, i have been struggling mentally, thorughout 
childhood,  i have been experincing alot of pain/ traumas 
doubt, and fear. expericinng loneliness, and sadness. at a very young age,
from being touched, having relations with someone that i called a friend/brother before
understanding the hardships of the after math,or being feelings been neglected by someone  i loved,
or being bullied at school,  or being called name "gay" which lead to question am i gay?  i have experinced alot of  pain/trauma that i have never faced 
or talked about to anybody.  i already had past traumas, 
i spent alot of time adjusting/adapting to enivorments,
and people pleasing to be accepted by others, doing things to get by.
it  has truly affected other around me hurt others around me, as the past year went by  i realized i bured alot  js to get by to the point  i have hurted someone that 
in my life that meant alot to me. i never have faced my feeling for a long time
i have been avoiding my feelings, and emotions for a long time.
i js pushed them deep down inside of me, at of 20 i am at the point of realzing my self seeing my self more clearly
and understanding my past traumas
