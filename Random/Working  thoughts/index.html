     i feel stuck and  numb honestly on a job search   so i could pay off bowie, i dont need nobody tell me i am going backwards 
     i may be moving forward on ground  level but i was more forward mentally, people have been teeling  icould have stayed but honestly tht shit was too muvh 
     i was all over the place scared parniods,  i am js healing after  years feeling healed peopl , i see other succes but  honestly  idont feel like i am succeding 
     it was too much people was believing me  and i  was not believing in me, my life is js all over the place, everybody   supported me but my intenrta world was shaking facing things thati have never faced before
     i was js working on creating a good and a random js sad thought js pop up, and talkig with my college consoler she was telling me 
        that "sometimes we think we doing what best for us but sometimes we not" and that could be true but ever been in a spot where  i have everything in your power ad it feeel ike u are 
     being pulled in every way    i js recieved a texted  today  from on one that i have cut off he was one the biggest person that 
      believe in me  off because i could not tell what was fake or real,  i have cause trouble to  ngl like it was all hime 
       and i have feelt pain since the 5th grade here  i am 20 still  at the same spot,stuck in confued it not even worse</p>
<div class="paragraph-box"></div>
        <p>    I am honestly at the point of my life where i can say i am disaligned with myself, like i have does 
                hard thing before but when  u stay in your thoughts for to long and it feel like life happened around u 
                u had big dreams to become sometimes but your emotion have gotten in the ways i may have gotten in the way of me me js 
                started to heal properly this time,  one of hards of them them all meeting news people and feeling confused 
                i feel like iam boxed in with my thougts i dont even know how to move forwards it like  iam being pulled 5 different wayd
                and i relaize  i m ight js be a little slower than i  think and as i pushed myself  and things like that talked t o this person that all that i am
                i  have carried a lot with  a little bit understanding like real bad, talking about building another life, tuh it felts like i havent even builf this one
                like this shit it hards and i have trained mself to be a  a people pleaser i am smart and all but i have sat with my self hoping that thoughts would get me thought 
              which is has before but it do not  nomore and i see  evebody get there life together  while  it js feell like i js  it js build armot to 
              protect meand something that is hurting me the worst is me being 20 still feeling like  i am xhild in a adult body 
              someone close to me always told  me applied  knowledge but damn does it feel  like i aint learn nothin about life at alll 
              i have been in life sometimes it js make me  feel like  iam worthlesss was  i even worth the investment,  and  all the thalking that i have done
